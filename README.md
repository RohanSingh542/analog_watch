## 🚀 Features

- Real-time analog clock
- Smooth rotation of hour, minute, and second hands
- Stylish clock face and frame using background images
- Fully responsive and centered layout

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The HTML sets up the structure with three divs representing the hour, minute, and second hands.
- CSS styles the clock, positions the hands, and adds background images.
- JavaScript uses `setInterval` to update the rotation of each hand every second based on the current time.

## 🧩 Customization

- Replace `clock.png` with your own clock face design.
- Replace `clock_frame.png` to change the outer frame.
- Adjust hand sizes and colors in `style.css` to match your theme.

## 📦 Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure `clock.png` and `clock_frame.png` are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
